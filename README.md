## Synopsis

This is an educational project that is intended for learning purposes only. This is a to-do web application that allows a user to add or delete notes. I built this web application during an online Web Developer bootcamp. Its purpose was to become familiar with integrating javascript and jQuery to formulate an app. This application is not connected to database but it is operational.


## Motivation

This was created to further educate my knowledge of jQUERY and Javascript.
